The processor follows the Harvard Architecture with separate data and instruction memory spaces. 
Each of them contains 16 elements of a 32-bit memory space.

DATA MEMORY
It allows the internal transfer of data between GPRs and data memory.
It also allows the transfer of data from the external world into the data memory via the din and dout buses.
The din and dout buses are 16 bits each.
The address in data memory is specified by the 0-16 bits in the IR (immediate data).

PROGRAM MEMORY
The instructions provided in binary format in the inst_mem.mem file are transfered to the array for program memory. 
Each instruction is executed after a delay of 4 clock ticks one after the other. 
The Program Counter (PC) is used to keep a track of the instruction getting executed. 
The PC always points to the next instruction similar the PC of an x86 processor.
