This model contains a 32-bit Instruction Register following the given structure:
BITS       
31-27    Operation Type
26-22    Destination Register
21-17    Source Register (1)
16       Mode Selection (Register (0)/ Immediate (1))
For Mode 0:                         For Mode 1:
15-11    Source Register (2)        15-0    Immediate Data
10-0     Unused

The instructions are provided in a binary format in an external text file inst_mem.mem.

The processor supports register, immediate, direct and indirect addressing modes. 
The 6 bits in the IR allow 32 possible types of operation of which 25 (5 arithmetic, 7 logical, 4 memory transfer and 9 jump) operations have been provided.
Similarly, there are 32 possible general purpose registers that can act as source or destination registers.
The 16 bits provided for Immediate Data acts as an address in direct addressing mode, data in immediate addressing mode and address of data memory in case of data transfer.
