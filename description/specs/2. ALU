The processor allows the following operations:

ARITHMETIC:
movsgpr rdst; 
mov rdst, rsrc;
add rdst, rsrc1, rsrc2;
sub dst, rsrc1, rsrc2;
mul dst, rsrc1, rsrc2;

All the GPRs have been considered to be 16-bit registers.
The SGPR is a special GPR used to store the MSB 16 bits after a mul operation.

LOGICAL:
or rdst, rsrc1, rsrc2;
and rdst, rsrc1, rsrc2;
xor rdst, rsrc1, rsrc2;
xnor rdst, rsrc1, rsrc2;
nand rdst, rsrc1, rsrc2;
nor rdst, rsrc1, rsrc2;
not rdst, rsrc1;
